### FileUpload

FileUpload is a technical field control that let's you upload a file into a specific folder. Since it is only for uploading, it should be combined with another field control that let's you save the reference(s). It has only *new mode*.
The uploaded file is added to the repository as a ```Content```. Files with extension .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png are created as ```Image```, all the other files are created by default with the type ```File```.
