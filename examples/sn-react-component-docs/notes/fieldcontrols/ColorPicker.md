### ColorPicker

The ColorPicker Field Control displays a color picker based on the current Color Fields configuration. The chosen color will be stored in the Color Field in hex. It is actually a [react-color](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/) ```SketchPicker``` an its ```presetColors``` prop could be filled if the value of the ```Palette``` property of a ColorField in the CTD is set.
